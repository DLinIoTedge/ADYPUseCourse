    \item Requirements ( added in SysML)
    \begin{enumerate}
         \item  Formalised version of Requirements  ( Excel spreadsheet, IBM DOORS , SAP IPD etc ) used for dependency associations
         \item SysML specifications define the requirements modelling ( tool set is from open source or from particular company)

SysML define a visual and graphical representation of
textual requirements, specialised associations between themselves or with other elements of the
model, and how they can be managed in a structured and hierarchical environment

requires a higher level of coupling between system
engineering and the acquisition process to support SoS ( system of systems ), as well as the need for higher
levels of lead system integrator (LSI) support

\begin{block}{Acquisition Timeliness  }

The systems that are
developed by the acquisition process need to have risk-managed processes that are not just
qualitative (the dominant method used today) but also quantitative where the risks can be
measured with accepted and agreed-upon metrics that can be tightly coupled and integrated
into an engineering system.

\begin{block}{Acquisition Process  }

The acquisition process is not design-driven. The  acquisition process is
oversight-driven and document-driven.

Cost optimization is very difficult to
achieve because system performance is hard to quantifiably measure as the system is
being developed and assessments and trade-offs are being made. Finally, there is limited
modeling of the system to vet lessons-learned which would enhance oneâ€™s ability to make
supportability improvements or forge an improvement strategy.

\begin{block}{Total Ownership Costs  }

Total ownership costs (TOC) are difficult to predict and control. The acquisition cost
incurred during the development cycle is only a fraction of the total ownership cost of any
system. In fact, the development cost is often the minority cost component of the TOC of the
system throughout its lifetime.

finally, what would be needed in addition to integrate these tools.
