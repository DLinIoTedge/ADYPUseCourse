\begin{block}{Stereotypes to extend the architectural}
\begin{enumerate}
 \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \item  Specify interfaces on ports to represent information exchange between components.
    \item    Use stereotypes to extend the architectural modeling language by defining custom metadata for each subsystem or component in the diagram.
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Stereotypes  }
\begin{block}{Example}
 A stereotype extends the modeling language with domain-specific metadata. A stereotype adds properties to the root-level architecture, component architecture, ports, connectors, data interfaces, value types, functions, requirements, and requirement links.

 CubeSat Model-Based System Engineering Project template, available from the Simulink® start page, under Aerospace Blockset™. 
 
 It demonstrates how to model a space mission architecture in Simulink with System Composer™ and Aerospace Blockset for a 1U CubeSat in low Earth orbit (LEO). The CubeSat's mission is to image MathWorks Headquarters in Natick, Massachusetts at least once per day. The project references the Aerospace Blockset CubeSat Simulation Project, reusing the vehicle dynamics, environment models, data dictionaries, and flight control system models defined in that project.

\begin{block}{Analyze Architecture }


\url{ https://in.mathworks.com/help/systemcomposer/ug/analyze-architecture.html}


 Perform static analysis on a System Composer™ architecture to evaluate characteristics of the system.

Analysis is a method for quantitatively evaluating an architecture for certain characteristics. Static analysis analyzes the structure of the system. Static analysis uses an analysis function and parametric values of properties captured in the system model.

Use analyses to calculate overall reliability, mass roll-up, performance, or thermal characteristics of a system, or to perform a SWaP analysis.

\end{block}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\begin{block}{Static analyses}
Write static analyses based on element properties to perform data-driven trade studies and verify system requirements. Consider an electro mechanical system where there is a trade-off between cost and weight, and lighter components tend to cost more.

\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{block}{Decision process}

Decision process involves analyzing the overall cost and weight of the system based on the properties of its elements, and iterating on the properties to arrive at a solution that is acceptable both from the cost and weight perspective.
\end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\begin{block}{Profile to an architecture model }
Apply the profile to an architecture model and add stereotypes from that profile to elements of the model (components, ports, or connectors).

Specify values for the properties on those elements.

Write an analysis function to compute values necessary for the trade study. This is a static constraint solver for parametric and values of related properties captured in the system model.
\end{block}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\begin{block}{Instance architecture model }

Create an instance of the architecture model, which is a tree of elements, corresponding to the model hierarchy with all shared architectures expanded and a variant configuration applied. Use the Instantiate Architecture Model tool.

Run the analysis function and then see analysis calculations and results in the Analysis Viewer tool.
