\begin{block}{Understanding of CPSs  }
Cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as autonomous vehicles, are intelligent and networked. Close collaboration between stakeholders from different disciplines is necessary right from the start of development.

\frametitle{Model-Based Engineering for Cybersecurity}

\begin{block}{Understanding of CPSs  }
 In the automotive sector in particular, the collaboration of the car manufacturer extends to several suppliers. The increasing complexity in the design of such CPSs makes interdisciplinary and cross-company collaboration more difficult. Here, requirements specifications serve as a support for communication. 
\end{block}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Model-Based Engineering for Cybersecurity}

\begin{block}{Problem in ISO/SAE 21434  }
A lack of overall understanding of such CPSs and their numerous interfaces jeopardizes the assurance of safety-relevant security. ISO/SAE 21434, which applies to the automotive industry, requires the creation of a cybersecurity concept at the beginning of the product development process. 

The problem is that ISO/SAE 21434 only prescribes WHAT must be done, but does not define 

\colorbox{red}{ \textcolor{white}{HOW this is supposed to be done methodically.} }

\begin{block}{Compliance to Industry Standards }

Automate verification of models and code to fulfill requirements from cybersecurity standards such as ISO/SAE 21434, IEC-26443, and DO-326. The IEC Certification Kit provides an overview on how to apply MATLAB, Simulink, Polyspace, and add-on products to ISO/SAE 21434, in addition to functional safety standards (ISO26262, IEC 61508). The kit helps you to build and qualify your development process for safe and secure embedded systems.
